\section{Related Work}

Providing ``mobile IP'' services is common in cell networks, since users are
largely truly mobile and so need a built-in method to have changing IP addresses
are part of the network design~\cite{ltemob,mobileip,Kurose}. While this largely
solves the problem for cell networks, it does not provide interoperability for
cell-phones that reconnect to WiFi networks, which do not have the same
functionality. This limitation is indicative of a larger limitation---the
network must support the requirements of a mobile-IP infrastructure. This
contrary to arguments in~\cite{Saltzer}, because it requires support through the
whole stack. Furthermore, these solutions often require support by client
applications and potentially servers (which may or may not understand the
complexities of mobile-IP services, resulting in errant behavior).
OpenFlow~\cite{McKeown} also
provides features for mobility with flows, but also requires extensive support
in the hardware and network.

Other projects and papers, such as Chandrashekar's Service Oriented
Internet~\cite{chandrashekar2003service} and Saif's Service-Oriented Network
Sockets~\cite{Saif} discuss designs for, essentially, session layer network designs.
While \texttt{sesh} would eventually provide more session-like features than
simple reconnect and session tokens, that work is outside the scope of a class
project. However, much of the work in the aforementioned papers is extremely
relevant to the future of a library such as \texttt{sesh}.

A session layer protocol that explicitly provides reconnection is
\textit{fived}~\cite{wasptr-15-01}. \textit{Fived} runs as a daemon on both
endpoints, through which clients and servers can establish sessions.
\textit{Fived} provides a number of services that \texttt{sesh} does not yet,
but should in the future, support, such as service enumeration. However,
\textit{fived} incurs additional overhead by running as a daemon, whereas
\texttt{sesh} runs as libraries that interpose library calls, improving
performance.

Numerous projects focus on problem-avoidance for reconnecting dead TCP
connections~\cite{mosh,autossh,screen,tmux}. Solutions range from implementing
sessions on the server (which require forethought and explicit use of tools), to
reparenting processes to continue running on hangup (which is not a session), to
reestablishing a new connection automatically (which is also not a session). All
these solutions lack the usability and transparency of true sessions.
