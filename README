What's this, another useless project?

	That's right.


What's this one about?

	Networking. I needed a class project. So I'll use the same trick
	I always use: let's do something dumb by tricking programs via
	LD_PRELOAD.

	So, like, apps on my phone do a bad job of switching over to WiFi.
	Instead, what if I had a library that I could shove into a process
	which would allow it to reconnect to a server when it gets a signal?
	That'd be pretty cool.


Does it work?

    Well, kinda. It's more a proof of concept. There's a lot of hacks
	involving pthreads and signals that are Bad Ideas, along with a pretty
	severe limitation in that the server can't fork... Really, I've only
	tested it with netcat. But I expect that with some extra (read: a lot
	more) work, it could actually work on ssh. But it would be very
	insecure.


What's the point?

    Like I said, I needed a class project for networking. But hey, this is
	kinda fun! I'm pretty fond of the "close and dup a new TCP socket
	out from under the main thread before it notices anything change".
	It kinda feels like the golden idol at the start of the first Indiana
	Jones movie.
